## Project-Workflow

It goes without saying that we all need to read the full assignment PDF, rubric in 507 syllabus.

**Sid and Jaison** created the documents about deliverables and the ask. Will bring them togther with the assignment pdf; so we know the nature of the beast we are dealing with.

**Initial discovery** by looking at the datasets early as Paul is doing will help identify initial metrics etc that we can make a note of any discuss in the team meeting.  

## Basics

As this is a collaborative project on Github, a great way to manage and deliver this project is by 

- **Slow Down**
    - LOGIC > The assignment started this wednesday at night; most of us will need time to wrap our heads around it. we need to be patient and not rush as that might risk ovehwelming the rest.

- Formalizing individual **roles** and **work scope**
    - LOGIC > If we have overlapping roles it will create chaos and discord, impacting project deliverables.

- Working with **branches**
    - LOGIC > Individual work can be highlighted. Main branch is not messed with even accidently. We can do wat we want with our own branches. Hants will need to see individual work too. Branches would be a great way to showcase a proper basic collaborative project.

- Using **best practices** 
    - LOGIC > Collaborative work has some basic best practices esp when it comes to working collaboratively on github, repo version control, analytics, etc.

- Determining **guidelines**
    - LOGIC > Collaborative work for a project of this sort can have issues if guidelines are not there. Eg. how to pull and push commits, what commits t do and what not to etc. If managing one repo is an issue, a collaboratively worked on repo is a minefield.
