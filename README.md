## Project-Workflow

It goes without saying that we all need to read the full assignment PDF, rubric in 507 syllabus.

**Sid and Jaison** it would be great if you both could individually map the assignment pdf to the rubric and list simple steps and deliverables for the project.

As this is a collaborative project on Github, a great way to manage and deliver this project is by 

- Formalizing individual **roles** and **work scope**
    - LOGIC > If we have overlapping roles it will create chaos and discord, impacting project deliverables.

- Working with **branches**
    - LOGIC > Individual work can be highlighted. Main branch is not messed with even accidently. We can do wat we want with our own branches. Hants will need to see individual work too. Branches would be a great way to showcase a proper basic collaborative project.

- Using **best practices** 
    - LOGIC > Collaborative work has some basic best practices esp when it comes to working collaboratively on github, repo version control, analytics, etc.

- Determining **guidelines**
    - LOGIC > Collaborative work for a project of this sort can have issues if guidelines are not there. Eg. how to pull and push commits, what commits t do and what not to etc. If managing one repo is an issue, a collaboratively worked on repo is a minefield.
