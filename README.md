# SBU-Sports-Metrics

## Pls Read the FULL ASSIGNMENT PDF and RUBRIC in 507 syllabus because doing so will
- help understand the assignment
- help come up with creative ideas
- bring us all on the same page
- each of us has to do commits into the repo in our own names, so we need to know what we are doing and are on top of it all: We all have things going on; we have to balance it out.

Not knowing coding should not be a discouragment because we have all got the skills from 506, 504 and 507. It certainly does not mean not giving our best effort to this project.

We can all pitch in many ways. Listed below in WORKFLOW are some ways that came out of our first meeting today 10/24. 

>> **LLM Use:** when help from any LLM or tool is taken, please mention it in any work done. Ethical use, which includes giving credit where AI too(s) is used, is acceptable in education settings.

## Workflow

<details>
<summary>Github</summary>

<br />

**Org Repo** 
- Please note that ONLY **PAUL** pushes and commits to the repo for now. 
- The rest of us work in our local VSCode, etc. 
- The individual bit in part 1 just needs screenshots, which can be added anytime before Dec 18. 
- We'll make sure all do commits individually.

**Committing individual work** 
- To keep it simple, we are not using branches. We have subfolders for each of us for individual commits. We MUST avoid any MERGE CONFLICTS. 

>> **STEPS TO COMMIT TO NAMESAKE SUBFOLDER**

- When we push the whole local stuff gets pushed to main. Therefore, we need to ensure we commit to just the subfolder with our name. 

**Paul** to test commit a "test file" or ur "individual pdf etc" to his named folder.

- Commands to test pushing to named subfolder. 

```bash
cd your-repo
git add root/subfolder/foldername/*
git commit -m "Update by Paul"
git push origin main
```

**References** 
- Please list all your sources in some file in AMA style using a tool like <a href="https://www.mybib.com/tools/ama-citation-generator">this</a>. Even if using LLMs, especially for lit reviews, research, etc. 

**Inital Setup & Exploration** 
- Let's all get the setup and basic raw file discovery done by next meeting 10/31. 

**Metrics**
- **Sid** 
    - based on the comments shared in the Teams Chat, please build on <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OPB1lbhWZfwa0I2fBVeQRgSOsEjmTX4N/view?usp=drive_link">Jaison's analysis</a>
    - Re: Teams chat messages, there are ideas shared about researching metrics.

**Metrics**
- **Metrics Ranges** 
    - **Naira** For the one pager you shared, please look up reference ranges and what they mean
- **Merics Research** 
    - **Naira** Re: messages in teams chat.

**5 Sports** 
- Basketfall (M&W), Soccer (M&W), Football seem to be good choices because of data volume and NCAA based research opportunities.
- Earlier we were exploring Lacrosse M & W, Basketball M & W, Soccer M or W seem to be good. .
    - LOGIC >> when each of us takes a metric and with it a sport, we will have a focused approach to the project and know the specific dataset drilled down to two focused variables.

<summary>Done</summary>

<br />

**5 Sports** 
- **PAUL** has shared his findings in teams, so now we can determine Lacrosse M & W, Basketball M & W, Soccer M or W.

**Metrics** 

- Naira has looked into the metrics; and has <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R-qnnoZuQb98LAnnHjDDmJQgyfOLqqAM/view?usp=drive_link"> shared </a> a one pager we can work work with to better understand the metrics.

- Following up on our call yest, **JAISON** please think about and create a plan for the Metrics building on our discussion. Part 1.3 and 1.4 could help. **SID**, please coordinate with Jaison on this metrics work he and I discussed.

**GitHub**

- One Repo vs a forked
    - We should all work from one repo. Need to ask Hants if he is okay with it. He'd like to see work of all in one repo. Let's get an okay from him for the forked repo. 

**One Repo vs a forked** 
- We should all work from one repo. Need to ask Hants if he is okay with it. He'd like to see work of all in one repo. Let's get an okay from him for the forked repo. 

**Initial discovery:** 

- By looking at the datasets early as Paul is doing will help identify initial metrics etc that we can make a note of any discuss in the team meeting. The images in teams a great way to learn from his work. he is a professional coder, we can all learn from him, when he has not gone to Mars! (**Mars** is anytime you are away PQ, not just upstate!)

**Deliverables:** 

- <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17LduVg3WvynBAhsVIPSz_1B0waTUVw2e/view?usp=drive_link"> Jaison shared</a> a tabular deliverables with details mapped to rubric. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QmyHZ6C8zxeYClI2dNw2fpnXIkcEc5iq/view?usp=drive_link"> Sid shared</a> a  simpler deliverable document. from the assignment PDF with deliverables and parts. I used these and the assignment PDF to create the dashboard so we know the nature of the beast we are dealing with.

- <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D2qgsdDQvDmkh-0KBP8ZeCN6XTDnlafE4FvzQxHsMNw/edit?usp=sharing"> This Project Dashboard</a> will help us track the project and our work. It is for use in dark theme; I have dry eye syndrome so can only use dark themes. It is a WIP and I'll keep updating it. Please use it to plan your project work.

## Basics

- **Best practices** 
    - LOGIC > Collaborative work has some basic best practices esp when it comes to working collaboratively on github, repo version control, analytics, etc.

- **Guidelines**
    - LOGIC > Collaborative work for a project of this sort can have issues if guidelines are not there. Eg. how to pull and push commits, what commits to do and what not to etc. If managing one repo is an issue, a collaboratively worked on repo is a minefield.

<summary> Done </summary>

- **Slowing Down**
    - LOGIC > The assignment started this wednesday at night; most of us will need time to wrap our heads around it. we need to be patient and not  rush as that might risk ovehwelming the rest.

- Formalizing individual **roles** and **work scope**
    - LOGIC > If we have overlapping roles it will create chaos and discord, impacting project deliverables.

- Working with **branches**
    - LOGIC > Individual work can be highlighted. Main branch is not messed with even accidently. We can do wat we want with our own branches. Hants will need to see individual work too. Branches would be a great way to showcase a proper basic collaborative project.
