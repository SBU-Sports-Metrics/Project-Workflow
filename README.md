It is for use in dark theme; I have dry eye syndrome so can only use dark themes. It is a WIP and I'll keep updating it. Please use it to plan your project work.

## Project-Workflow

It goes without saying that we all need to read the full assignment PDF, rubric in 507 syllabus.

**Deliverables:** We now have simpler version of the assignment PDF with deliverables and and project parts. I used these and the assignment PDF to create the dashboard so we know the nature of the beast we are dealing with.

**Initial discovery:** By looking at the datasets early as Paul is doing will help identify initial metrics etc that we can make a note of any discuss in the team meeting. The images in teams a great way to learn from his work. he is a professional coder, we can all learn from him, when he has not gone to Mars! (**Mars** is anytime you are away PQ, not just upstate!)

**Metrics** Naira has looked into the metrics; and has created a one pager we can work work with to better understand the metrics.

**LLM Use:** when help from any LLM or tool is taken, please mention it in any work done. Ethical use of AI tools is allowed in education settings.

## Basics

As this is a collaborative project on Github, a great way to manage and deliver this project is by 

- **Slow Down**
    - LOGIC > The assignment started this wednesday at night; most of us will need time to wrap our heads around it. we need to be patient and not rush as that might risk ovehwelming the rest.

- Formalizing individual **roles** and **work scope**
    - LOGIC > If we have overlapping roles it will create chaos and discord, impacting project deliverables.

- Working with **branches**
    - LOGIC > Individual work can be highlighted. Main branch is not messed with even accidently. We can do wat we want with our own branches. Hants will need to see individual work too. Branches would be a great way to showcase a proper basic collaborative project.

- Using **best practices** 
    - LOGIC > Collaborative work has some basic best practices esp when it comes to working collaboratively on github, repo version control, analytics, etc.

- Determining **guidelines**
    - LOGIC > Collaborative work for a project of this sort can have issues if guidelines are not there. Eg. how to pull and push commits, what commits t do and what not to etc. If managing one repo is an issue, a collaboratively worked on repo is a minefield.
